#when class name is used as a reference to call a method from the parent class then there is an error, 
    which is debugged only by decalring the method as static

#but instead of using the class name but the "super" keyword, the method is called without using the static declaration of the method
    in the class.
    
#and without referencing anything, the method is can be simply called without any error.
