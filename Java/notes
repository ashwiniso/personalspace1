#when class name is used as a reference to call a method from the parent class then there is an error, 
    which is debugged only by decalring the method as static

#but instead of using the class name but the "super" keyword, the method is called without using the static declaration of the method
    in the class.
    
#and without referencing anything, the method is can be simply called without any error.


#what is the return type of a static method which just intriduces a new line.


#like string pool where a value is referenced by multiple variables (pointers) to save memory, is there also something like pools for other data types, and does this also apply to
objects of other clases. refernecing to a single memory location if the value is same. "==" meaning the memory location is same for both pointers
